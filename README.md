## **Introduction**

This challenge requires a climate analysis for a Hawaiian vacation, using Python and SQLAlchemy. The analysis is comprised of a precipitation analysis for the most recent 12 months of data in the dataset, and a temperature analysis of the station with the greatest number of observations. The precipitation analysis is plotted visually on a bar graph and the temperature analysis is represented with a histogram.
